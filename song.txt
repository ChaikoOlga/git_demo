Come to me, come to me
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Boy we can get on
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is devil's door
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret

Bang!

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy

Falling in through the floor
Baby this is devil's door
